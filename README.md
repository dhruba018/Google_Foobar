### Google Foobar Challenge

This repo contains the coding problems I encountered in the so-called **Google Foobar** challenge, and my (!) solutions. Grateful to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) and other web resources that I've used to either understand the ideas or get some coding ideas (and some code chunks- unintentional mostly). One thing I gotta say that- I really enjoyed thinking about these problems and brainstorming some solution, plus to see what other people have come up with!

#### Constraints
##### Python
* Your code will run inside a **Python 2.7.13** sandbox. All tests will be run by calling the **solution()** function.  
* Standard libraries are supported except for _bz2, crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, signal, termios, thread, time, unicodedata, zipimport, zlib_.  
* Input/output operations are not allowed.  
* Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.  

##### Java
* Your code will be compiled using standard **Java 8**. All tests will be run by calling the **solution()** method inside the **_Solution_** class  
* Execution time is limited.  
* Wildcard imports and some specific classes are restricted (e.g. _java.lang.ClassLoader_). You will receive an error when you verify your solution if you have used a blacklisted class.  
* Third-party libraries, input/output operations, spawning threads or processes and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.  
* Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.
