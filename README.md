## Google Foobar Challenge

![Foobar progress](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/blob/master/Figures/foobar_progress41.png)

This repo contains the coding problems I encountered in the so-called **Google Foobar** challenge, and my (!) solutions. Grateful to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) and other web resources that I've used to either understand the ideas or get some coding ideas (and some code chunks- unintentional mostly). However, I do have to say that- I really enjoyed thinking about these problems and brainstorming some solution, plus to see what other people have come up with! Plus, I learned a bunch of new things and gained some interest in studying Graph Theory and Topology while taking enough time to chill between problems (may be a little too much ;-) )- so it's a win-win!

### Problems
**Level 1.** One problem at this level. Pretty easy!  

* [Problem_1: Minion Task Scheduling](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_1)

**Level 2.** Two problems at this level. Needs knowledge of basic search algorithms/graph theory. Still easy enough.  

* [Problem_2.1: Don't Get Volunteered](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_2.1)
* [Problem_2.2: Hey I Already Did That](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_2.2)

**Level 3.** Three problems at this level. Similar to Level 2, but needs some dynamic programming approaches too. Bit of a mixed bag.  

* [Problem_3.1: Find the Access Codes](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_3.1)
* [Problem_3.2: The Grandest Staircase of Them All](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_3.2)
* [Problem_3.3: Prepare the Bunnies' Escape](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_3.3)

**Level 4.** Two problems at this level. The fun begins here (!)- but honestly these problems are much more intriguing and thought provoking. Needs knowledge of applied math- specially geometric transformations and combinatorics.  

* [Problem_4.1: Bringing a Gun to a Guard Fight](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_4.1)
* [Problem_4.2: Distract the Guards](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_4.2)

**Level 5.** One problem at this level. This one was wild- needs knowledge of pure math!  

* [Problem_5: Disorderly Escape](https://github.com/dhruba018/Google_Foobar/tree/master/Problem_5)

### Constraints

**Python.**  
* Your code will run inside a **Python 2.7.13** sandbox. All tests will be run by calling the **`solution()`** function.  
* Standard libraries are supported except for `_bz2`, `crypt`, `fcntl`, `mmap`, `pwd`, `pyexpat`, `select`, `signal`, `termios`, `thread`, `time`, `unicodedata`, `zipimport`, `zlib_`.  
* Input/output operations are not allowed.  
* Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.  

**Java.**  
* Your code will be compiled using standard **Java 8**. All tests will be run by calling the **`solution()`** method inside the **_`Solution`_** class  
* Execution time is limited.  
* Wildcard imports and some specific classes are restricted (e.g. `java.lang.ClassLoader`). You will receive an error when you verify your solution if you have used a blacklisted class.  
* Third-party libraries, input/output operations, spawning threads or processes and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.  
* Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.
