The coding problems I have encountered in the **Google Foobar** challenge, and my (!) solutions. Grateful to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) and other web resources that I've used to either understand the ideas or get some coding ideas (and some code chunks- unintentional mostly). One thing I gotta say that- I really enjoyed thinking about these problems and brainstorming some solution, plus to see what other people have come up with!
