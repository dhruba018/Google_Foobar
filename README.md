The coding problems I have encountered in the **Google Foobar** challenge, and my (!) solutions. Grateful to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) and other web resources that I've used to either understand the ideas or get some coding ideas (and some code chunks- unintentional mostly). One thing I gotta say that- I really enjoyed thinking about these problems and brainstorming some solution, plus to see what other people have come up with!

### Constraints
#### Python
	Your code will run inside a **Python 2.7.13** sandbox. All tests will be run by calling the **solution()** function.  
	Standard libraries are supported except for bz2, crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, signal, termios, thread, time, unicodedata, zipimport, zlib.  
	Input/output operations are not allowed.  
	Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.  

#### Java
	Your code will be compiled using standard **Java 8**. All tests will be run by calling the **solution()** method inside the **_Solution_** class  
	Execution time is limited.  
	Wildcard imports and some specific classes are restricted (e.g. java.lang.ClassLoader). You will receive an error when you verify your solution if you have used a blacklisted class.  
	Third-party libraries, input/output operations, spawning threads or processes and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.  
	Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.
