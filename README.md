The coding problems I have encountered in the **Google Foobar** challenge, and my (!) solutions! Grateful to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) and other web resources that I've used to either understand the ideas or get (unintentionally mostly) the codes.
